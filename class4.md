## Wireframe and Design

### What is wireframe?

A wireframe is a practice that allows designers to define and plan their information heirarchy

A wireframe is a draft and plan of how you want your site to look like.

### Wireframe examples

you can either draw a wireframe by hand or you can use different softwares to design it.

wireframes drawn by hand have a couple different advantges. For example, if you are drawing by hand it is easy to make changes early on.

if you are using a paper prototype it can help byy being able to ahve testers test at every stage of development.

you can always take what you have drawn and switch over to a software later.

## 6 steps to make a wireframe

### 1 do your research

understand your audience. know exactly what you want to do and convey with yyour website.

### 2 Prepare your research for quick reference

there will be a lot of different data that you aquire while conducting research. You will not remember it all.

### 3 map out your user flow

plan ahead by figuring out various things that might make your wireframe more difficult, such as how mny different pages will

your users ned to go to, and what is the flow you expect out of your users.

Think about where they might be coming from, such as from marketing ads, and where you want them to end up at.

you want to do your best to mmake sure to plan out the user flow so that the users can navigate your site on their own and dont need

continuous support or help.

### 4 draft, dont draw. sketch, dont illustrate

A wireframe is just that. the bare wires. aspect of your wireframe needs to be perfectly drawn. focus on more important things

such as features and formats not colors and visuals.

### 5 add some detail and get testing

once you have your outline of your wireframe copmpleted now you can add in a little bit of details. not bulk detail though.

This isnt the step to finish the site. You are simply adding a small amount of detail to make the website clearer and more easily

accessible to the user. think simple. this is the first step to connect form and function together

### 6 start turning your wireframes into prototypes

now that you have added a little bit of detail and have ran a few tests and worked those out you are now ready to begin finnishing.

This is the step where you will smooth out the lines and rough edges start making the site more appealing and user friendly.

# 3 key principles

## 1 clarity

be clear about what your wireframe is representing so that your site is clear about what you are providing.

## 2 confidence

Build user confidence through a site that is easy to manage and navigate with a clear intent or purpose.

## 3 simplicity is key

Dont make the site over the top with too much information. additional links or even visuals. same with the wireframe.

You need to fully understand what your wireframe is just like you ned your user to fully understand what your site is.

# Mozilla HTML basics

## what is HTML

HTML is hypertext markup language. it is the code thatr is used to structure a webpage and its content.

HTML consisit of a series of elements which you use to enclose or wrap different parts of the contant to make it

appear a certain way or act a certain way.

## Anatomy of an HTML elemant

![anatomy visual reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png)

The main parts are

#### 1 the opening tag

This consists of the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.

This states where the element begins. ex:<p>

#### 2 the closing tag

This is the same as the opening tage except that it includes a forward slash before the element name.

This states where the element ends ex:</p>

#### 3 the content

this is the content of the element.

#### 4 the element

the opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

elements cna also have attributes.

attributes contain extra information about the element that you dont want to appear

an attribute should always have the following.

1. a space betweeen it and the element name

2. the attribute name

3. the attrbute value wrapped by an openng and closing quotation marks

## nesting elements

you can put elements inside of other elements as well. this is called nesting,

## Empty elements

some elements are empty and contain no content.

# Semantics

in programming Semantics refers to meaning of a piece of code

semantics in HTML. HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling.

For example, <h1> element is ta semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role or meaning of a top level heading on a page.

<h1> this is a top level heading</h1>

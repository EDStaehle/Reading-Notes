### What is growth mindset to me?
In my own words growth mindset is the mindset that you are never complete and you always have room to grow. You should not strive for perfection because being perfect means you have nowhere left to go and no way to improve. Instead you should pursue a goal of being better today than you were yesterday. Life, whether its easy, or hard can very easily become stagnant and predictable.

### 3 Reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset:

- There is not a person alive that cares about you, and your future more than you, so why quit on yourself just because your are struggling.
- No one was born knowing how to code everyone started somewhere. Its very easy to convinve yourself youre not making any progress. whether thats in coding or any other journey. Always remember to look back in time and think about where you were when you first started, and where you are now. I promise you everytime you do that you will realise just how far you've come, and what you are truly capable of.
- Failure is the pinnacle of success. You will only learn so much from your successes, because success is easy to accept, but defeat or failure is where you will really grow. Because failure is so hard to accept 9 times out of 10 when you fail you will try to find the reason you failed, and when you search for that reason you find your oown flaws, and how to fix them.

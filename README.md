### What is growth mindset to me?
In my own words growth mindset is the mindset that you are never complete and you always have room to grow. You should not strive for perfection because being perfect means you have nowhere left to go and no way to improve. instead you should pursue a goal of being better today than you were yesterday.

### 3 Reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset:

- No one starst a skill as a master 
- No one was born knowing how to code everyone started somewhere
- Failure is the pinnacle of success

## Learning HTML

you will creat a basic link by wrapping the link and an anchor tag `<a></a>`
the href containt the target that contains the link and what you would want it to say on your webpage
the best way to make your link accessible to all users is to use clear link wording so that users and search engines can easily find your links. this will also make it easy for users that skim read to be able to understand what the link is.

## learn css

normal flow is the default styling of css along side html standard styling

A block-level element fills available space of a parent element while an inline element jsut fills the space of the content an inline element can sit inside of a block-level element. you can not change the width of an inline elemetn unless it is treated like a block-level element
Static positioning is the dafualt styling that every HTML element gets

A few advantages of using absolute positioning are that we can creat isolated fatures. the styled elements wont interfere with the layout, can be dragged around, used as pop up boxed or menus. This also styling content within the box rather than its relative position

Fixed postioning uses relative position and interferes with other css boxes. absolute does not and can be overlayed on top of other css boxes

## Learn JS

a function declaration is naming the function and a function invocation is calling on the declared function for another pieces of code.

a parameter is set when the function is declared after the name in () and an argument is what needs to meet the parameter for the function to run.

## Miscellaneous

Two benefits of pair programming that bennefits me is Learning from fellow student  and work eviroment readiness. These will help me a lot because every student will understand the content of a lesson better and different than i will. Work enviroment readiness will help me get ready for dicussing my code and problems with it with a team and will make overall teamwork better.

# api best practices 

REST stands for Representational State Transfer

REST API's are designed arounf resources.

a url such as `https://adventure-works.com/orders/1`

GET POST PUT PATCH

https://adventure-works.com/orders this is a good url because it focuses on the nouns or resource and not the verb or operation

a chatty API is an api the give a large number of small resources and typically you want to avoid making or using these apis.

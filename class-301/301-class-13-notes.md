## CRUD basics

Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?  

I would use the put method to update

Which REST methods require an ID parameter?

PATCH PUT DELETE and GET if get is only getting one specific item.

Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

REST is used to complete the CRUD tasks

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. Build the server and create schema layout with options if using a NoSQL server

2. connnect through endpoints

3. assign env to use data base like mongo

4. create logic for data points such as if you are using get put delete or post

5. Add auth error handling and any other needed logic or middleware and conduct testing if everything tests correcly and performs as needed you are done.

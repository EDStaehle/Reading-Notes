## functional programming

Functional programming is using functions to create clean and maintainable software

a pure function is a function that doesnt rely on a state and will always provide the same results

bennefits of a pure function is that you dont have to worry about the results of the function being different regardless of state changes

you are not able to change or modify

an expression if call referentiually transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding cvalue and vice-versa without changing the programs behavior

a module is a section of code that can be called upon if and when needed with keywords. similar to how a componenet works

it imports for node like how import imports for react

make sure you have exproted the module and then require ('./fileName) in the file that you need it in

export/require

## React docs thinking in react

the single responsibility principle states that a component should on ideally do one thing. this will help prevent all of your code breaking if one thhing goes wrong.

A static build is when you are not using state because you dont want the rendered data to change.

it needs a root.render

should it change. can it change. when should it change .

a higher order function is a function that operates on other functions

it is setting a variable = to a function and using that variable with () to set parrameters.

map and reduce filter results from functions into arrays to access different parts of the data or pick out specific parts of the data.

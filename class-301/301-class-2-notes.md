# State and Props

## react lifecycle

Data flows in from the constructors.

gets states from props

constructor React Updates render componentDidMount componentWillUnmount

endes the render method stating that the componenet mounted.

## React state vs props

1. you can pass in data such as array objects.

2. the biggest difference is that state can change props can not.

3. we re render our appplication everytime a state is changed in a prop.

4. we can store data, numbers, names, any kind of information that can change based on user input.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to learn more about changing states based on what is needed.

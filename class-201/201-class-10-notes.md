## what went wrong? troubleshooting JavaScript

1. A syntax error is a spelling error in your code that cause the code not to run correctly. There can be hard to spot but easy to fix. Loigic arrors is when the syntax is correct but the code is not what it is meant to be. cause the code to run but not give the correct output.

2. A error that ii often come across is spelling errors as i will type when looking at my keyboard and occasionally press a key without meaning to and this will cause syntax errors.

3. This topic will influence my long term goals as it will help me know what kind of bug I should be looking for and how to fix it.

## The JavaScript Debugger

The JS debugger tool is almost like a spell check or proof reading. where it will allow you to pause your code at certain points to allow you to boil down a problem in your code snippets.

Breakpoints are tools in the JS debugger that allow you to split your code snippets and pause your code execution.

The Callstack section shows you what code was actually executed before the breakpoint so you know where to look for a bug.

## Things I want to know more about

Exploring the debugger and learning how to use it as best as I can.

## JavaScript canvas

The canvas tag allows the developer to style HTML aspects without the use of CSS and gives an alternative styling method.

The importance of the canvas closing tag is that it ends the canvas tag and any content between the opening and closing tag is fallback content.

The getContext() is used for dimensional styling on canvas

## chart

Chart.JS is used for creating charts of data and using canvas styling on an HTML site

bar, pie, bubble

Some advantages of using chart over table is it is more visually pleasing, easier to read, and understand.

It would help me by creating a more dynamic webpage for data.

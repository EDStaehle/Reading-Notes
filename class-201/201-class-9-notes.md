# Class 9 Reading notes

Web forms are so important because it is one of the main popints of interaction between a user and a website. they allow sending and storage of data.

One of the main keys to focus on when designing a form is user experience. You want you user to have an easy and streamlined expierience on your site. Another thing to consider is writing your html code so that it is easy for readers to understand for debugging purposes.

## HTML Forms

1. the `<form>` Element. This is the most important element for creating a form as it defines the behavior of a form.
2. The `<fieldset>` element this is very similar to how a `<div>` or `<section>` element works where you group together i
3. The next element is the `<legend>` element this is similar to a title element or a header element.
4. The `<label>` element is used to define a name for a widget
5. The `<input>` is used to define a action for user input.

## JS

An event is like turning the key in your car so that the ignition can strike the starter and the starter will move the flywheel so that the pistons will start turning and at the same time the fuel injectors will start spraying gas so that the spark plugs can cause ignition m,aking the engine run.

You need to provide the event and callback argument.

An event object is a function parameter.

a bubble listens for all nested elements. Capturing is when you grab an event listener when a bubble is being used to invoke other code or functions.

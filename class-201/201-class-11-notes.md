## Video and audio content

1. In the beginning audio and video were sourced through plugins such as flash and silver back. they could not be hardcoded into an html site.

2. src is the actual source of the video. Controls lets the user control the video such as start and stop or volume.

3. fallback content is important if the browser is unable to support the coded video. This is used so that if a user is using an older browser they can still have a way to access the video you wanted them to see.

4. Once upon a time there were two salesmen called flash and Silverlight. These two salesmen were the only people in the world that sold their product but they were not very reliable. sometimes they would leave peoples house unlocked and sometimes they never delivered their product at all, but one day two new salesmen appeared named audio and video. instead of selling the product they sold the recipe to make the product. This allowed buyers(coders) to create their own product meaning they didnt run the risk of their house being unlocked(security compromised) or the product not being delivered at all(accessibility issues). This made the distribution of the product much easier and safer for all users of the product.

## A complete guide to grid

1. Grid differs from flexbox because it puts all content on a html page into a grid. making it so that content only takes up the desired space at a desired postion removing the need for margin spacing to get things to be in place where they should be.

2. Grid container is all content that will be on the HTML web page. Grid item is the individual items in a grid layout or the individual items or elements in the HTML. Grid line is the lines of the grid seperating the collumns and rows.

## Responsive images

1. Developers should make images responsive because not only does it add more dynamics to a website but it also provides more content to an HTML webpage.

2. `<img>` is the HTML element when you are hard coding an img into a HTML document. `<srcset>` is used to src multiple different imgs into one element, and `<sizes>` is used to define a universal size to all images being coded.

3. srcset is a direct filepath to the image and doesnt require other stylings to code.

## Things I want to know more about

Making dynamic imgs and giving them more and more purposes and seeing how far i can take it.

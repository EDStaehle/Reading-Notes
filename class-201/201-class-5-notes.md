## HTML media

- alt is used to add a description of an image before a user clicks on it

- by making sure the image title is clear and concise

a figure would be usefull when you want to add content like a description to an image but

a SVG image is best for using grids or tables and a gif image is a smalll image or animated image

-when displaying a screen shot you should use a lossless format of image o that the content does not become fuzzy and hard to read a good one wopuldf be lossless webp or png

## Learn CSS

A forground is the very front of the page such as the HTML elemnts color like texts. the background is the color oof the body or any coloring behind the body.

I would add css page to his doc and grab an element from his HTML in the css page like the body and i would chage the background color to something like blue.

you should consider accessibility and readabiliity with your users. when choosing fonts

one way to add spacing to the H1 is to use yexy transform full width or you can use the ccc element letter spacing or word spacing.

## The box model

one day there were two bullies walking through the halls at school. these bullies were named padding and margin. Anytime they needed room for something they would push other kids away to create more room for themselves.

_ the first part is the margin this is the outter most layer of a html element. the next part is the border. this is inside of the margin and what is used to box in the content of the html element and will determine the size of the box. the next part is the padding this is the space between a border and the content this is used so that the content and the border do not overlap. the last part is the content box. this is the content of the html element.

## learn js

- you can store numbers strings and

- no because they are using multiplle different arrays within one array.

- = means it equals the assigned value += means it adds the assigned value -= means it subtracts the assigned value *= means it multiplies thye assigned value

- let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b; this will not return anything because for one you are incorrectly using () two you are not assigning a valuable or asking for a return of any kind.

-a real world example of a conditional statement would be if a user anwer answers a question correctly
-a loop is useful in javascript if you dont want a user to proceed unless a certain conditon is met such as answering a question or inputting a correct password

# intro to sql

## what I learned

I learned that sql is far more presice than i thought both in the type of data stored and in how you have to access that data. I learned that there are specific keywords and pharses used to access or manipulate different parts of the data. I think that will be something that will take time to completely learn and fully understand ![my image](intro-to-sql.png)

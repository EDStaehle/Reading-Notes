# questions for the reading assignment

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I would say that the one thing I can bring to the table would be my ability to learn as many different skills as I can. I have always been able to pick up new skills and learn different things very quickly. This has helped me become incredibly useful and flexible in almost any situation and has led me to become a sort of jack of all trades. I think this is a unique skill that makes me viable for many to all positions or work that is needed.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

The first thing I will do is to take a step back. Not a break but a step away from the situation. I like sometimes you have to take a step away from the paint to see the picture. 2. I will break the problem down into a smaller issues that can all be solved at once. This can help as it will make the overall more difficult problem easier to manage. 3. I will take a break. I have often noticed that when i am stuck on a problem for too long i can start to get frustrated this will often have the opposite effect of what i want to get. To prevent this after some time it is better to just take a break and relax and try to ensure i attack the problem with a clear head on my shoulders.

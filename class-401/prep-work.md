## DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem? - One of the more important factors to consider would be the  amount of data that you are trying to store. As discussed in the video Data Structures in 15 minutes. Different data structures have specific strengths and weaknesses in regards to how much data they are storing. For example in an array you can theoretically store as much data into one array as you'd like, however this can create issues with the data that you are storing running into other stored data as arrays are nothing more than stacked memory. Hashmaps are a great way to store and retrieve data but depending on the hash algorithm you use two keys can hash to the same memory location and cause a 'collision'. It is important to consider and weigh the individual pros and cons of the data structures and compare those to the amounts of data you need or might need to store.

2. How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack? - We can ensure we avoid an infinite recursive call stack  by having two parts to a recursive function. The base case and the recursive case. the recursive case is when the function calls on itself the base case is when the function doesn't call on itself AGAIN.

## things I want to know more about

I would like to know a lot more about run time complexity O(1) and O(n) and how to reduce runtime and runtime complexity.

### what is a text editor?

 A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on

your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that

allows you to write and manage text

#### what features should you look for when choosing a text editor?

* 1.) code completion

* 2.) syntax highlighting

* 3.) a nice variety of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue

* 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

### Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer

Every computer will come with its own text editor.

On Mac computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Text Edit.”

On Windows computers, the text editor that comes with your computer is called, “Notepad.”

I think you’ll find that when using the text editors that come on your computer,

that there are no special bells or whistles at all.

I think you’ll find that there is no code completion.

But what that means is your text editor won’t assist you in finding your mistakes.

You’ll haveto discover them on your own.

### The Command Line! Your window into the computer

#### So what are they exactly?

A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system.

You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

#### The Shell, Bash

Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell.

This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.

There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell.

## **Shortcuts**

The terminal may seem daunting but don't fret.

Linux is full of shortcuts to help make your life easier.

You'll be introduced to several of them throughout this tutorial.

Take note of them as not only do they make your life easier, they often also save you from making silly mistakes such as typos.

### Basic Navigation! Let's explore the system

#### see demo notes for examples and commands

#### Absolute and Relative Paths

There are 2 types of paths we can use, absolute and relative.

Whenever we refer to a file or directory we are using one of these paths.

Whenever we refer to a file or directory, we can, in fact, use either type of path

#### More on Paths

*tilde - This is a shortcut for your home directory.

eg, if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents

*dot - This is a reference to your current directory.

It could also be written as ./Documents

Normall this extra bit is not required but in later sections we will see where it comes in handy).

*dotdot- This is a reference to the parent directory.

You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy.

eg if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.

### More About Files! Kinda boring but essential knowledge

Everything is a File

Linux is Case Sensitive

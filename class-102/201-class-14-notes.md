using transform: translate to create a slide transition with multiple images.

## CSS transitions and animations

transitions allows the developer to change properties of an element over a small period of time

Animations allow more control without having multiple different states.

using CSS transitions can help make your page look less cluttered and more professional, It can also help you maintain user interaction and focus by having a dynamic interesting site.

This is a very important topic to me because I have recently gained a lot of interest in becoming a front-end developer.

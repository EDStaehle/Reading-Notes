## what is CSS for?

CSS is a language for speciifying how documents are presented to users

presenting means to convert the document into a usable form by your audience.

CSS can be used for very basic document styling. Such as changing the color and size of headings and links. it can be used to create layouts for a webpage.

## CSS syntax

CSS is a rule based language. you define the rules by specific groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of our webpage.

{h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

I this example the CSS rule opens with a secto wich selects which HTML element will be usedd. In ts case it will be the element for a heading >h1

Then there is a set of curly braces to input the CSS code

inside the braces will be one or more **declarations**, which take form of **property**and **value** pairs.
specify the property before the colon and the specify the value of the property after followed by a semicolon

properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. such as

color: red: or color: green;

# CLASS 6 READING NOTES

## Javascript

Javascript is a lightweight interpreted, or just in time programming laguage with first class functions. java script is not java

### standard objects

array, boolean, date, error, function, json, math,number, object,regexp,string,map,set,weakmap,weakset

### Expressions and Operators

instanceof, typeof, new, this

### Statements and Declarations

do-while, for-in, for-of, try-catch, let, var, const, if-else, switch

## Input Output in plain javascript

## variables

## What are variables?

variables are containers for storing data

when to use javascript var?

always declare JavaScrpt variables with `var`,`let`, or `const`

When to use JavaScript const?

If you want a general rule: alays use const to store a data value, but if you think the variable can change use let.

## Just like algebra

just like in algebra variables hold be such as x=5 or y=10

they are also used in expressions like z = x+y

JavaScript Identifiers.

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names these unique names are called identifiers

these can be short names like x and y or more descriptive like age sum totalvalue.

the general rules are  as follows

*Names can contain letters,  digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

*Names must begine with a letter

Names can also begin with $ and _ but for now just start with letters

*Names are case sensitive

*eserved words like javascript keywords cannot be used as names

## The Assignment Operator

In JS the equal sign = is an >assignment operator. not an >equal to operator

for example X= x + 5 does make sense in algebra becuase it is not saying that X is qual to x this is saying that X is increased bvy 5

## JavaScript data types

JS variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like jhon doe.

in programming, text values are called strings

strings are written in double or single quotes. numbers are written without quotes if you wrap a number in quoptes it will be treated as a string.

## Declarng a JavaScript variable

creating a variable in JavaScript is called declaring a variable.

you declare a JS variable with the `var` or the `let`

after declaring the varible it has not value . to assign the variable a value use the equal sign.

you can also assign it a value when you declare the variable

## One statment many variables

you ccan declare many variables in one statement start the statement with let and seperate each variable with a comma

## value = undefined

in programs there will often be times that a variable has no value to it, this can happen if something needs to be calculated or will be provided late like a name or a price

JavaScript treats _ as a letter

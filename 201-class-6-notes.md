An object is like a company where it consits of workers for the functionality and file systems where it contains the different data.

A bennefit of using an object literal is that you can transfer a series of related data.

objects differ from arrays because objects can store a collection of data rather than just a single value type.

If an objects property name is defined at runtime than you cant use dot notation you have to use braket notation.

this is how the function inside the object is call. this. can be called on mulitple times storing different data each time.

The DOM is a programming interface to change the document structure style and content. It is used to manipulate the website.

The relationship between DOM and JavaScript is that without DOM JavaScript wopuld not have any model or notion of web pages, or HTML documents. DOM is used as a web API to build websites for JavaScript.

## things I want to know more about.
